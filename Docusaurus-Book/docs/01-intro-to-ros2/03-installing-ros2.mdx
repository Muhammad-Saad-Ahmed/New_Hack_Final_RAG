# Lesson 1.3: Installing the ROS 2 Environment

## Learning Goals

-   Set up the required sources for installing ROS 2.
-   Install ROS 2 Humble Desktop on an Ubuntu system.
-   Source the ROS 2 environment to enable its commands.
-   Validate the installation by running a simple example.

## Prerequisites

-   An Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) system.
-   A user with `sudo` privileges.

<Admonition type="info" title="Why Humble?">
  ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill is a Long-Term Support (LTS) release, which means it will be supported with security updates and bug fixes for a longer period (until May 2027). This makes it a stable and reliable choice for learning and development.

## Installation Steps

These instructions are based on the official ROS 2 documentation.

### 1. Set Locale

Make sure your system supports UTF-8.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

### 2. Add the ROS 2 APT Repository

First, install the necessary dependencies for adding the ROS 2 repository.

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
```

Now, add the ROS 2 GPG key and the repository itself.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

### 3. Install ROS 2

Update your package lists and then install the full desktop version of ROS 2 Humble.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
```

This will install the core ROS 2 libraries, developer tools like RViz, and tutorials.

### 4. Source the Environment

To use the ROS 2 commands, you need to source the setup script in your terminal.

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

It's convenient to add this command to your `.bashrc` file so it runs automatically every time you open a new terminal.

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Validation Lab

Let's validate that the installation was successful and the environment is set up correctly.

1.  **Source your environment**: If you haven't already, open a new terminal or run `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`.
2.  **Run a talker node**: In one terminal, run the following command. It will start publishing "Hello World" messages.
    ```bash
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
    ```
3.  **Run a listener node**: Open a **new** terminal (and source the environment again if you didn't add it to your `.bashrc`). Run the following command:
    ```bash
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener
    ```
4.  **Verify communication**: You should see the `talker` terminal publishing messages and the `listener` terminal receiving and printing them. This confirms that your ROS 2 installation is working correctly.

Congratulations! You now have a working ROS 2 Humble environment ready for development.
