# Lesson 3.1: Understanding URDF

## Learning Goals

-   Understand the purpose of URDF in robotics.
-   Learn the basic syntax of URDF, including the `<robot>`, `<link>`, and `<joint>` tags.
-   Understand the difference between the `<visual>` and `<collision>` tags.
-   Create a simple URDF file for a single robot link.

## What is URDF?

**URDF** stands for **Unified Robot Description Format**. It is an XML-based file format used in ROS to describe all the physical properties of a robot. This includes:

-   **Kinematics**: The structure of the robot, including its links (the rigid parts) and joints (the moving parts that connect the links).
-   **Visuals**: How the robot should look in simulations and visualizations like RViz.
-   **Collision Models**: The geometry of the robot used for collision detection in physics simulations.
-   **Dynamics**: Physical properties like mass and inertia, which are important for realistic simulation.

By having a standardized format for describing a robot, ROS provides a wide range of tools that can automatically parse your URDF file and use it for simulation, visualization, and planning.

## Basic URDF Syntax

A URDF file is an XML file with a root element called `<robot>`. Inside the `<robot>` tag, you define the robot's structure using `<link>` and `<joint>` tags.

### The `<link>` Tag

A **link** represents a rigid part of the robot. It has a name and can contain three main sub-tags: `<visual>`, `<collision>`, and `<inertial>`.

```xml
<link name="my_link">
  <visual>
    <geometry>
      <box size="0.1 0.1 0.5" />
    </geometry>
    <material name="blue">
      <color rgba="0 0 0.8 1"/>
    </material>
  </visual>
  <collision>
    <geometry>
      <box size="0.1 0.1 0.5" />
    </geometry>
  </collision>
  <inertial>
    <mass value="1" />
    <inertia ixx="0.01" ixy="0.0" ixz="0.0" iyy="0.01" iyz="0.0" izz="0.01" />
  </inertial>
</link>
```

-   `<visual>`: Describes how the link looks. You define its shape (`<geometry>`) and color (`<material>`). The geometry can be a `<box>`, `<cylinder>`, `<sphere>`, or a 3D mesh file (`<mesh>`).
-   `<collision>`: Describes the physical shape of the link for collision detection. It's often simpler than the visual geometry to speed up physics calculations.
-   `<inertial>`: Describes the dynamic properties of the link, including its `<mass>` and `<inertia>` tensor. This is crucial for realistic simulation.

### The `<joint>` Tag

A **joint** connects two links and defines how they can move relative to each other.

```xml
<joint name="my_joint" type="revolute">
  <parent link="parent_link"/>
  <child link="child_link"/>
  <origin xyz="0 0 0.5" rpy="0 0 0" />
  <axis xyz="0 0 1" />
  <limit lower="-1.57" upper="1.57" effort="100" velocity="10" />
</joint>
```

-   `type`: The most common types are:
    -   `revolute`: A hinge joint that rotates around an axis.
    -   `continuous`: A revolute joint with no limits.
    -   `prismatic`: A sliding joint that moves along an axis.
    -   `fixed`: A joint that doesn't allow any motion. This is useful for rigidly connecting two links.
-   `<parent>` and `<child>`: Defines the two links that the joint connects.
-   `<origin>`: Specifies the pose (position and orientation) of the child link relative to the parent link.
-   `<axis>`: The axis of rotation (for revolute joints) or translation (for prismatic joints).
-   `<limit>`: (For revolute and prismatic joints) Defines the joint's limits of motion, as well as its maximum velocity and effort.

## Hands-on Lab: Create a Simple URDF

Let's create a URDF file for a single, simple link.

### 1. Create a Package

If you haven't already, create a package for your robot description files.

```bash
# In your workspace's src directory
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python my_robot_description --dependencies rclpy
```

### 2. Create a URDF Directory

Inside your new package, create a directory to hold your URDF files.

```bash
cd my_robot_description
mkdir urdf
```

### 3. Create the URDF File

Create a new file called `single_link.urdf` inside the `urdf` directory and add the following content:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot name="single_link_robot">

  <!-- A "world" link is often used as a fixed base -->
  <link name="world" />

  <joint name="fixed_joint_to_world" type="fixed">
    <parent link="world" />
    <child link="my_base_link" />
  </joint>

  <link name="my_base_link">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.5 0.5 0.2" />
      </geometry>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0.1" rpy="0 0 0" />
      <material name="light_gray">
        <color rgba="0.8 0.8 0.8 1.0" />
      </material>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.5 0.5 0.2" />
      </geometry>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0.1" rpy="0 0 0" />
    </collision>
    <inertial>
      <mass value="5" />
      <inertia ixx="0.1" ixy="0" ixz="0" iyy="0.1" iyz="0" izz="0.1" />
    </inertial>
  </link>

</robot>
```

In the next lesson, we will learn how to visualize this URDF file in RViz2, the ROS 2 3D visualizer.
