# Lesson 2.3: Services and Actions

## Learning Goals

- Understand the request/response communication model of ROS 2 services.
- Write a service server and a service client in Python.
- Understand when to use actions for long-running, feedback-providing tasks.
- Get an overview of how to write an action client.

## Services: Request/Response Communication

While topics are great for continuous data streams, **services** are used for synchronous, request/response interactions. A service has two parts: a **server** that provides the service and a **client** that calls it. The client sends a request and waits for the server to send back a response.

This is useful for tasks that have a clear start and end, like "get the robot's current position" or "calculate the inverse kinematics for this arm pose."

<Admonition type="info" title="Service Types">
  Like topics have message types, services have **service types**. A service type defines the structure of the request and the response. For example, the `AddTwoInts` service type has a request with two integers (`a` and `b`) and a response with one integer (`sum`).
</Admonition>

### Service Server Example

Here is a simple service server that adds two integers.

```python
# service_server.py
from example_interfaces.srv import AddTwoInts
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MinimalService(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_service')
        self.srv = self.create_service(AddTwoInts, 'add_two_ints', self.add_two_ints_callback)

    def add_two_ints_callback(self, request, response):
        response.sum = request.a + request.b
        self.get_logger().info('Incoming request\na: %d b: %d' % (request.a, request.b))
        return response

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_service = MinimalService()
    rclpy.spin(minimal_service)
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Service Client Example

And here is the client that calls the service.

```python
# service_client.py
import sys
from example_interfaces.srv import AddTwoInts
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MinimalClientAsync(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_client_async')
        self.cli = self.create_client(AddTwoInts, 'add_two_ints')
        while not self.cli.wait_for_service(timeout_sec=1.0):
            self.get_logger().info('service not available, waiting again...')
        self.req = AddTwoInts.Request()

    def send_request(self, a, b):
        self.req.a = a
        self.req.b = b
        self.future = self.cli.call_async(self.req)
        rclpy.spin_until_future_complete(self, self.future)
        return self.future.result()

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_client = MinimalClientAsync()
    response = minimal_client.send_request(int(sys.argv[1]), int(sys.argv[2]))
    minimal_client.get_logger().info(
        'Result of add_two_ints: for %d + %d = %d' %
        (int(sys.argv[1]), int(sys.argv[2]), response.sum))
    minimal_client.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Actions: For Long-Running Tasks

**Actions** are similar to services, but they are designed for long-running tasks that need to provide feedback while they are executing. For example, telling a robot to navigate to a specific location might take a long time. An action would allow the robot to provide feedback on its progress (e.g., "I am 50% of the way there").

An action has three parts:
- **Goal**: The request to start the long-running task.
- **Feedback**: Intermediate updates on the progress of the task.
- **Result**: The final outcome of the task.

We will cover actions in more detail in a later module, but here is a quick look at an action client for a Fibonacci sequence generator.

### Action Client Example (Fibonacci)

```python
# action_client.py
import rclpy
from rclpy.action import ActionClient
from rclpy.node import Node
from action_tutorials_interfaces.action import Fibonacci

class FibonacciActionClient(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('fibonacci_action_client')
        self._action_client = ActionClient(self, Fibonacci, 'fibonacci')

    def send_goal(self, order):
        goal_msg = Fibonacci.Goal()
        goal_msg.order = order
        self._action_client.wait_for_server()
        self._send_goal_future = self._action_client.send_goal_async(goal_msg)
        self._send_goal_future.add_done_callback(self.goal_response_callback)

    def goal_response_callback(self, future):
        goal_handle = future.result()
        if not goal_handle.accepted:
            self.get_logger().info('Goal rejected :(')
            return
        self.get_logger().info('Goal accepted :)
        self._get_result_future = goal_handle.get_result_async()
        self._get_result_future.add_done_callback(self.get_result_callback)

    def get_result_callback(self, future):
        result = future.result().result
        self.get_logger().info('Result: {0}'.format(result.sequence))
        rclpy.shutdown()

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    action_client = FibonacciActionClient()
    action_client.send_goal(10)
    rclpy.spin(action_client)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Hands-on Lab: Create a Service

### 1. Create the Node Files

In your ROS 2 package (`my_python_pkg/my_python_pkg`), create two new files: `service_server.py` and `service_client.py`. Paste the code from the examples above.

### 2. Update `setup.py`

Add entry points for the service server and client.

```python
# Inside setup.py
entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'hello_ros2 = my_python_pkg.hello_node:main',
        'talker = my_python_pkg.publisher_node:main',
        'listener = my_python_pkg.subscriber_node:main',
        'service = my_python_pkg.service_server:main',
        'client = my_python_pkg.service_client:main',
    ],
},
```

### 3. Build and Run

Build your package and then run the service and client.

```bash
# In your workspace root
colcon build --packages-select my_python_pkg
source install/setup.bash

# In one terminal, run the service server
ros2 run my_python_pkg service

# In a NEW terminal, run the client with two numbers as arguments
ros2 run my_python_pkg client 2 3
```

The client should print `Result of add_two_ints: for 2 + 3 = 5`, and the server will log the incoming request.

You have now mastered the basics of ROS 2 services!
