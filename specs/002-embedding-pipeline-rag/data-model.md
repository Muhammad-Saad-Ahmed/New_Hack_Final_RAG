# Data Model: RAG Vector Record

**Date**: 2025-12-25
**Feature**: [Embedding Pipeline Setup](../spec.md)

This document describes the structure of the data stored in the Qdrant vector database.

## Entity: `VectorRecord`

Represents a single chunk of text and its associated embedding vector.

### Fields

- **`id`** (UUID): A unique identifier for the vector record. Qdrant will assign this.
- **`vector`** (float array): The high-dimensional embedding generated by Cohere.
- **`payload`** (object): A JSON object containing the source data and metadata.

### Payload Structure

The `payload` object contains the following fields, which are indexed for filtering and retrieval:

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `text` | string | The raw text content of the chunk. | "ROS 2 is a set of software libraries..." |
| `source_url`| string | The full URL of the page the text was extracted from. | `https://.../what-is-ros2` |
| `page_title`| string | The title of the source page. | "What is ROS 2?" |
| `section_title`| string | The title of the section the chunk belongs to (if available). | "Core Concepts" |
