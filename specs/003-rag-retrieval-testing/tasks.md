# Tasks: RAG Retrieval and Pipeline Testing

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-rag-retrieval-testing/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend project**: `backend/` at repository root
- Paths shown below follow the project structure from plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create retrieving.py file in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T002 [P] Add retrieval-specific dependencies to backend/requirements.txt
- [x] T003 [P] Create environment configuration for retrieval in backend/.env

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 Initialize Cohere client in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T005 Initialize Qdrant client in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T006 [P] Implement get_query_embedding function in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T007 [P] Implement search_qdrant function in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T008 [P] Implement format_results function in backend/retrieving.py

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Query Qdrant for Similar Content (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable querying the Qdrant vector database with a search query to retrieve the most relevant text chunks that match the query

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a query string to the retrieval system and verifying that the returned results are semantically related to the query, delivering accurate search results.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T009 [US1] Implement retrieve function in backend/retrieving.py that orchestrates query → embedding → search → format
- [x] T010 [US1] Add command-line interface to retrieve function in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T011 [US1] Implement error handling for empty queries in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T012 [US1] Test retrieval functionality with sample query in backend/retrieving.py

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 4 - End-to-End Query Processing (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Enable submitting a query and receiving clean JSON output with relevant results so that the RAG system can be integrated into applications

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting various queries and verifying that the system consistently returns well-structured JSON responses with relevant content.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T013 [US4] Implement clean JSON response formatting in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T014 [US4] Add proper error response handling in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T015 [US4] Validate JSON schema compliance for responses in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T016 [US4] Test end-to-end query processing with various inputs in backend/retrieving.py

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 4 should both work independently

---
## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Verify Metadata Retrieval (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Ensure that metadata (URL, chunk_id) returns correctly with search results so that content can be traced back to its source

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by querying the system and verifying that each returned result includes correct metadata pointing to the original source document and location.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T017 [US3] Verify metadata extraction from Qdrant results in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T018 [US3] Validate metadata fields (source_url, chunk_id, page_title) in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T019 [US3] Test metadata retrieval with sample queries in backend/retrieving.py

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1, 4, AND 3 should all work independently

---

## Phase 6: User Story 2 - Validate Retrieved Content Accuracy (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Verify that retrieved chunks match the original text so that the retrieval process maintains content integrity

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by comparing retrieved chunks with the original source content to verify no corruption or modification occurred during the ingestion/retrieval process.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T020 [US2] Implement content similarity validation function in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T021 [US2] Add cosine similarity check for retrieved content in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T022 [US2] Test content accuracy with known original texts in backend/retrieving.py

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [x] T023 [P] Add comprehensive documentation to backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T024 [P] Add logging functionality for debugging in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T025 Add performance monitoring for query response times in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T026 Handle edge cases (Qdrant down, empty results, malformed queries) in backend/retrieving.py
- [x] T027 Run quickstart.md validation with implemented retrieval functionality

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US4 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with previous stories but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all foundational tasks together:
Task: "Implement get_query_embedding function in backend/retrieving.py"
Task: "Implement search_qdrant function in backend/retrieving.py"
Task: "Implement format_results function in backend/retrieving.py"

# Launch all User Story 1 implementation tasks:
Task: "Implement retrieve function in backend/retrieving.py that orchestrates query → embedding → search → format"
Task: "Add command-line interface to retrieve function in backend/retrieving.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 and 4 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 4
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Stories 1 and 4 independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 + 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 4
   - Developer C: User Story 3
   - Developer D: User Story 2
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
